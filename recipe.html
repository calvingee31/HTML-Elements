  <h1>Ingredients</h1>
  <ul>
    <img src="large eggs.jpg">
    <li>2 Jumbo eggs</li>
    <img src="ground beef.jpg">
    <li>1/3 of ground beef</li>
    <img src="butter.jpg"height="200">
    <li>One stick of butter</li>

    <li>Ketcup</li>
    <li>Store bought Shredded Cheddar Cheese</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Procedures</h2>
  <p>Crack two eggs in the bowl then put a little bit of salt and pepper and then whisk it well. If you want something tasty for your egg, my choice is just to add a little bit of garlic powder or onion powder.
</p>
<h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Let start our beef filling, first put a small pot onto a stove and turn on medium heat.</li>
    <li>Once the small pot was heated, add the 1/3 ground beef into a small pot without oil. Because the beef creates oil.</li>
    <li>Start grinding the beef with your spatula and you don't need salt and pepper because ketchup creates that flavor.</li>
    <li>Once the beef was cooked, turn off the heat and start adding ketchup and stir it regularly.</li>
    <li>Now beef filling is done, it's time to create an omelette, first of all, I like to get a small frying pan because it's good for the flipping an omelette but if you using a regular size pan then it's hard to flip it.</li>
    <li>Now I will start put a small frying pan onto a stove and turn on medium heat</li>
    <li>First, grab your butter knife or regular knife then slice your stick of butter and put it on a small pan</li>
    <li>Once the butter was melted, add your half of your egg mixture and for bottom of the egg to cook for 5-6 minutes</li>
